# Engine_Overheating

#A car company has been receiving constant complaints about the engines in their new car. Customers report engine overheating, so the company has compiled a table of the following data from these complaints. The Internal Temperature records the temperature of the engine when it was overheating. Plotting the data could help identify which categories are most likely to be contributing to this issue. Organize the data into lists, storing data from each category in ascending order. Then plot these lists against the corresponding Internal Temperature, displaying only one plot at a time in the cell. If there seems to be a clear linear relationship (a straight line) then the company will know to investigate these categories further.

What categories are most likely contributing to this issue? Was there any data that wasn't useful?
Analysis: The name data and customer age weren't useful. The external temperature and the coolant level had the most impact on contributing to the internal temperature heating up.
